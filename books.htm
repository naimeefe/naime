<h2>The Little Prince</h2>
	<img src="TheLittlePrince.jpg">
	<p>So when you look at the sky at night,<br>
it will be as if all the stars were laughing;<br>
as though in one of the stars I live and I will be laughing…<br>
You will have stars that know how to laugh!<br><br>

And he laughed again.<br>
And when your sorrow is comforted (with time all sorrows pass)<br> 
you will be glad that you have known me. You will always be my friend.<br> 
You will want to laugh with me. And you will open your window,<br> 
and your friends will be surprised to see you laughing as you look up at the sky!<br> 
Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh!'<br>
And they will think you are crazy. It will be my little joke that<br>
I will have played on you…<br>
